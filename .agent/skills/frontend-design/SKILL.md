# Frontend Design

This skill guides the creation of distinctive frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme (e.g., brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful and unique. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Use CSS variables.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments (e.g., staggered reveals on page load). Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition
Unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth. Use gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, and grain overlays.

## What to Avoid
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics (Inter, Roboto, Arial).
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white).
- Predictable layouts and component patterns.
- Cookie-cutter design.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist designs need restraint and precision.
